    <h2>Lease Agreements</h2>
	<h5>What is a lease?</h5>
	<img src="Images/handshake.jpg" alt="handshake" width="400" height="200"></img>
    <p>The agreement that a tenant makes with the landlord to rent the property is called a lease. Although a lease can be verbal, it is rarely the case, and there are several instances where it cannot be verbal. If the lease is over a year, or if the building has 12 or more units, then the lease must be in writing.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Typical items covered in a lease</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Start Date of Lease</li>
		<li>End Date of Lease</li>
		<li>Security Deposit Amount</li>
		<li>Terms of Security Deposit</li>
		<li>Rent Due Date and Late Fees</li>
		<li>Responsibility for Rent</li>
		<li>Landlord rights of Entry</li>
		<li>Responsibility for Utility Costs</li>
		<li>Pets</li>
		<li>Guests</li>
		<li>Repairs</li>
		<li>Lawn Maintenance and Snow Removal</li>
		<li>Smoking</li>
		<li>Amenities</li>
		<li>Use of House and Subletting</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>Illegal lease clauses</h5>
	<img src="Images/signing.jpg" alt="signing" width="400" height="200"></img>
    <p>Do not sign a lease with illegal clauses. One example of an illegal clause is that the landlord can evict you without a court hearing. Another example of an illegal clause is that the landlord does not have to make repairs or maintenance as required by law. Another example of an illegal clause is the landlord does not have to pay for damage to your property if the damage is the fault of the landlord. Another example of an illegal clause is the landlord can keep your security deposit if move out within a specified time frame. If you are already in a lease with an illegal clause, the landlord will not be able to enforce the illegal clause, and thus you do not have to obey the illegal clause.</p>
