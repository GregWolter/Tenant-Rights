    <h2>What to do Before Renting</h2>
    <h5>Inspection</h5>
    
	<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/544965/pexels-photo-544965.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260" alt="inspection" width="400" height="200"></img>
		<p>When you are looking for an apartment, ask to see the apartment you will live in.  Do not let the landlord show you one just like it. Inspect the apartment very carefully.  Look for damage and other problems.  Check the plumbing, lights, appliances, heating, electrical system, locks, and windows.  Turn on the faucets, flush the toilets, open the windows, and turn on the lights.  It is a good idea to write it all down, especially if you think you will apply. See this repair list and make notes about what you see. Talk to tenants who lived there before or other people in the same building.  Ask if they have complaints about the building or management.
		</p>
		<p>If you are interested in the apartment, check for records of any violations of state law or local housing codes at that address.  You can do this by calling the city, the health department or checking on the internet. See if there is anything you should know about the property. If you think there might be problems with the apartment when you inspect it, it is really important to do this.  These agencies can tell you if anything was wrong with the apartment when it was last inspected, and what has been done to fix the problems.
		</p>

    <h5>Pre-Lease Deposit</h5>
 
		<p>Some landlords ask you to put money down if you are interested in an apartment.  This is called a deposit-to-hold or pre-lease deposit.  It is different from a security deposit because you pay it at the time you apply for the apartment.  This is before the landlord does a background check and agrees to rent the apartment to you.  This is not an application fee.
		</p>
		<p>A landlord cannot charge you a pre-lease deposit without a written agreement. The agreement might be part of the application.  Read everything carefully before you sign it.  The agreement will have the rules about you getting the money back or not.   If a landlord does not rent the apartment to you, they have to return your pre-lease deposit.  If the landlord does rent the apartment to you, the pre-lease deposit has to be put toward the security deposit or the rent.  But, if the landlord says you can rent the apartment and you turn it down, the landlord is allowed to keep the pre-lease deposit money.  It all depends on what your written agreement says. Read the agreement before you sign it.
		</p>
	<h5>Get to Know the Owner</h5>
	<div class="myPic"> <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181715/pexels-photo-1181715.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260" alt="Houses" width="300" height="200"></div>
		
		<p>It is important to know who your landlord will be and who the owner of the building is. You should also know how to contact the landlord or owner.
		The building owner's name and address must be posted in a prominent place in the apartment building.  Ask to have it pointed out to you.
		</p>
	<h5>Tenant Screening</h5>
	
		<p>Landlords often use tenant screening companies to find out about a tenant before renting to them. Screening companies report information like rental history, unlawful detainers (evictions), credit history, and criminal records. State and federal laws control these companies. You may have the right to sue the tenant screening company if it does not follow the law. Contact a lawyer or your local legal services office if you are having problems with a tenant screening company.
		</p>
		<p>You have a right to a copy of your tenant screening report. A tenant screening company has to give you a copy of your tenant screening report when you ask for it. The tenant screening company may make you pay for a copy of the report, but they cannot charge you more than $9. If you have been turned down for housing in the past 30 days because of information in the report, your copy of the report is free.
